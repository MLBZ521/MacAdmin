Jamf Pro
======

**Update:**  *I've done some recent house cleaning, which included filing things into more appropriate locations, whether folders, or other repos.  If you can't find something in this repo, or another, feel free to reach out.*

___

This repo will contain content I have created while managing a Jamf Pro environment.

**Admin Tools** - Scripts, etc, that are mainly intended for Full Jamf Pro Admins

**Extension** Attributes - Various EAs that I have created

**Scripts** - Various scripts for managing devices in Jamf Pro

**Site Admin Tools** - Various "tools" I have created that help provide additional functionality for Site Admins that is not natively available.  Also "helper" tools, and tools that can be used to get information on a system.

##### Note: #####
Everything in this repo is configured for a use in Jamf Pro, however, almost everything can be converted to work in another management solution.  I have other repos that are dedicated to macOS management content which is not configured explicitly for a Jamf environment.  Most content will not be duplicated, so what is in here, will not be there and vice versa.
