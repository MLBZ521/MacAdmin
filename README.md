JAMF Scripts
======

This repo will contain scripts I have written for JAMF usage.


#### assign_Mac2User.sh ####

This script assigns a Mac to a User in JAMF Inventory records for a specific device.  I had a request for a way to tie users to machines where users were not using directory accounts to sign in.  This was as quick script that I threw together to accomplish this.  I later converted this to an application using Swift and Cocoa.
